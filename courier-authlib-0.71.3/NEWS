                         Courier Authentication Library

   A new SQLite authentication module has been added to the Courier
   Authentication Library. It's considered to be in experimental or testing
   status.

Debugging

   To generate additional debugging messages, edit the authdaemond startup
   script (installed in /usr/local/bin by default), and add the following to
   the script:

 DEBUG_LOGIN=2
 export DEBUG_LOGIN

   Debugging messages from the authentication daemon processes will be sent
   to the syslog facility, and recorded in whatever log file syslog is
   configured to use (usually /var/log/messages or /var/log/maillog).
